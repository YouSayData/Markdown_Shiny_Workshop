## Quarto

Quarto is a modernisation of R Markdown. It's a tool for integrating prose, code, and results for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. R Markdown files are designed to be used in three ways:

1. For communicating to decision makers.

2. For collaborating with other data scientists (including future you!).

3. As a modern day lab notebook where you can capture not only what you did, but also what you were thinking.


### How it works

It contains three important types of content:

- (optional) YAML header
- chunks of R code (with YAML options)
- text mixed with simple text formatting

### Example


The code below demonstrates two color palettes in the [viridis](https://github.com/sjmgarnier/viridis) package. Each plot displays a contour map of the Maunga Whau volcano in Auckland, New Zealand.

#### Viridis colors

```{r}
#| label: volcano

image(volcano, col = viridis(200))
```

#### Magma colors

```{r}
#| label: volcano_magma

image(volcano, col = viridis(200, option = "A"))
```
